## Should I include sur + yr + sur*yr and/or sur + site + sur*site?
# These would mean that the effect of surrogate on target is different for different yrs (or sites)
# i.e. the slopes of regression lines are different for different sites or that there are 3 dimensions
## Should I include sur + yr + site + yr*site?
# NOT included because at this level of complexity, the surrogate would arguably not be a "simple" way to predict the target
# This would mean that the effect of time on the target is different for different sites and that
# the surrogate improves the model, but does not modify the effect of time or site on the target.
# This might be the case if different sites experience different conditions over time
# (e.g. disturbance is more common at one site than another and the level of disturbance changes over time)
# AND that there was additionally variation in the data that could be further explained by the surrogate

## Checking model assumption of negative binomial***
# Negative binomial models assume the conditional means are not equal to the conditional variances.
# This inequality is captured by estimating a dispersion parameter that is held constant in a Poisson model.
# Thus, the Poisson model is actually nested in the negative binomial model.
# We can then use a likelihood ratio test to compare these two and test this model assumption.
# To do this, we will run our model as a Poisson.
